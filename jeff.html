			<p>The pacifist’s walk is a lonely one.</p>
			<p>He stands at the front of Room 215 in Tate Hall. Ten people occupy the lecture hall built for 65. His drooping eyes scan the group as he sips water from a mason jar mostly stripped of its label.</p>
			<p>He looks back at his notes and resumes his lecture. One of his topics is the ongoing U.S. drone war, and his primary audience is Young Americans for Liberty, an organization that promotes freedom on college campuses.</p>
			<p>At the end of the talk, the group breaks into discussion. After about 15 minutes, the speaker steps away from the podium.</p>
			<p>“Let me grab a chair,” he says. “I feel silly standing up here alone.”</p>

			<div class="subhead">A passion for peace</div>

			<p>Jeff Stack is the mid-Missouri coordinator for <a href="http://forusa.org/">the Fellowship of Reconciliation,</a> a national nonprofit that advocates nonviolence. It favors less oppressive foreign policies and opposes the death penalty. Stack is in the minority of Americans on most of the issues he endorses.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/Death-Penalty/Public-Opinion-on-the-Death-Penalty.aspx" target="_blank" class="body_link">A 2010 Pew Research Center survey</a> found that just 30 percent of Americans are against the death penalty. <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/02/11/continued-support-for-u-s-drone-strikes/" target="_blank" class="body_link">Less than one-third of Americans disapprove of the U.S. drone attacks,</a> and the number is dropping, according to a February 2013 Pew study.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.people-press.org/2011/05/03/public-relieved-by-bin-ladens-death-obamas-job-approval-rises/1/" target="_blank" class="body_link">Also from Pew, 72 percent of Americans were relieved to learn that the U.S. had killed Osama bin Laden,</a> and 60 percent called themselves proud of their government’s actions. Stack is not one of them.</p>
			<p>“We should condemn the killing of humans wherever the violence is committed,” he says.</p>

			<div class="subhead">Faith-driven initiative</div>

			<p>Stack, a 53-year-old Chicago native, is the oldest of six children. He was raised Catholic and attended weekly service and catechism. Eventually, his beliefs diverged from those of his parents.</p>
			<p>
“I found too much hypocrisy in general in the Catholic Church,” he says. “The treatment of women was particularly troubling to me. Why shouldn’t women be allowed to be priests? Why can’t priests get married if they wish? There were a lot of teachings that seemed too Draconian to me.”</p>
			<p>
In the winter of 1982, Stack discovered <a href="http://www.catholicworker.org/" target="_blank" class="body_link">the Catholic Worker Movement,</a> an international community that exercises Jesus’ instructions to feed the hungry and care for the homeless. Founded by journalist Dorothy Day and philosopher Peter Maurin in 1933 during the Great Depression, the movement also instructs its followers to be peace activists for Christ.</p>
			<p>
St. Francis House in Columbia is one of more than 200 Catholic Worker communities around the world. The chapter members live and meet at the house in north Columbia.</p>
			<p>
Stack considers himself a Catholic Worker member but not a Catholic. He lived at St. Francis House for five years starting in 1988.</p>

			<div class="pull_quote">
			<p>“We should condemn the killing of humans wherever the violence is committed,”</p>
			</div>

			<p>Steve Jacobs, who helped found St. Francis House, says Stack’s old room was basically a big closet where the residents stored supplies and donations.</p>
			<p>The house’s nightly visitors were also unpredictable. Every evening, St. Francis House opens its doors to the homeless.</p>
			<p>“It was a little like a saloon in the Wild West,” Jacobs says. “You never knew who was going to come through those swinging doors.”</p>
			Although Stack moved out two decades ago, Jacobs says Stack still has a peripheral presence.</p>
			<p>“He’s always around in some sense,” Jacobs says. “Sometimes he’ll volunteer to come in and make breakfast for the guys. He really has a heart for the homeless.”</p>

			<div class="subhead">A turning point</div>

			<p>Stack moved to Columbia in 1977 to attend the Missouri School of Journalism because he values equality, justice and human rights — things he still advocates for today.</p>
			<p>On Nov. 14, 1979, a group of students held an anti-Iranian rally near Memorial Union, and Stack, an undergraduate reporter at <span class="italics">The Maneater,</span> covered it. He stayed after most protesters and journalists left. Stack was watching the remaining students debate when a woman backed up to the north lawn of Ellis Library with a gun and held it to her face.</p>
			<p>Some reporters returned to the scene.</p>
			<p>Stack recalls some of them saying, “If she kills herself, this’ll be a front-page story.” More university and Columbia police arrived, and a counselor talked the distressed woman into giving up her weapon.</p>
			<p>“It made me begin to wonder about (journalism) altogether,” Stack says. “I realized I had much greater admiration for (the counselor) than I did for the people of the profession I was thinking I wanted to be a part of.”</p>

			<div class="subhead">A practiced patience</div>

			<p>On a Friday at Rock Bridge High School, Stack sits with his back straight, and his mouth in its signature half smile. His table, covered in pamphlets and brochures, stands across from the school’s main office. Students sit along the sides of the hall — eating, chatting, laughing.</p>
			<p>Once a month, Stack sits through the school’s lunch hour and offers a counterperspective to what military recruiters say. Some of the handouts offer information on the military draft. Others explain what it means to be a conscientious objector.</p>
			<p>Sometimes students slow their walk to glance at the literature. Stack greets them warmly when they come near.</p>
			<p>“Hi, how are you today?”</p>
			<p>Students speed up and occasionally offer a, “Fine, thanks,” over their shoulder.</p>
			<p>As they turn the corner and converge with their peers, Stack says: “You’re welcome to some information. If not, have a great day.”</p>
			<p>Still, his back remains straight, and his smile holds steady.</p>
