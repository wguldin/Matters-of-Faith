He found himself taking his first yoga class, studying as a monk at a yoga center in Massachusetts then traveling the world on a spiritual journey before finally settling in Columbia to open alleyCat yoga studio.</p>

			<p>Ken McRae’s voice spreads until it fills the room. It’s level, soothing.</p>

			<p>Yogic.</p>

			<p>“Notice how the body is taking the breath in, how the body is releasing the breath back into the room,” he says. “That is, of course, the first anchor, drawing the attention present into this moment.”</p>

			<p>Seated on a plush plum-colored cushion on his living room floor, McRae faces a wooden altar adorned with tea candles and incense and topped with the Hindu god Ganesha. His legs are crossed, and his eyes are closed. The lids are smooth and untroubled.</p>

			<p>The moment engulfs him. 

			<p>In another moment, years earlier, McRae was a teenager browsing a bookshop in Canada when a red cover caught his eye – Why Buddhism Works. He picked up the book and flipped through it, sparking a lifelong interest in Eastern religions. Years later, as a successful businessman in Toronto, the memory of the book would stir in McRae’s mind. Although he was materially successful — a wealthy computer consultant with a half-million-dollar house and opera tickets — he knew something was missing.</p>

			<div class="subhead">A practicing yogi</div>

			<p>McRae discovered yoga and was drawn to the feelings of contentment and wholeness that accompanied the practice. He took his first class shortly before Christmas of 1988 with a free pass that he’d kept in his sock drawer for three years. “My way of experiencing my life started to change, almost as if my eyes were opened,” he says. “Almost like Dorothy going from a black-and-white world to a colored world.”</p>

			<p>He enrolled in a 750-hour yoga teacher training program in Toronto and eventually quit his job, sold his house, opera tickets and dog and moved with his wife at the time, Kathleen Knipp, to the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health in Lenox, Mass. He trained as a monk for five years before embarking on a spiritual tour through India, Bali and Italy.</p>
			
			<div class="pull_quote">
			<p>“This feeling deep inside that I get is so much more than any material or accomplishment could ever provide for me,”</p>
			</div>

			<p>When he first came to the Kripalu Center, McRae was a different person, says Gary Halperin, who studied alongside him there. “He was kind of serious (and) introspective, a little bit closed off,” he says. McRae blossomed with yoga training and became more outgoing and comfortable in his environment, Halperin says.</p>

			<p>Now McRae is a practicing yogi. He runs Global Yoga Journeys, a company that arranges international yoga and meditation retreats. He also teaches Kripalu at alleyCat Yoga in Columbia, which he founded in 2006 and moved to its current location in October 2011. Today’s alleyCat studio, swathed in purples and deep-greens, is high-ceilinged and airy with front-facing windows that let in two large rectangles of natural light. Here McRae can relax, breathe deeply and take life as it comes.</p>

			<p>“This feeling deep inside that I get is so much more than any material or accomplishment could ever provide for me,” McRae says. “And once you’ve tasted that, why would you not want more of that?</p>

			<div class="subhead">For the mind, body and soul</div>

			<p>McRae is one among a number of Americans who view yoga as spiritual. According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, one-fifth of the U.S. public is religiously unaffiliated. Of those, roughly three in 10 say they believe in yoga as a spiritual practice. According to the National Health Interview Survey, more than 13 million Americans used yoga in 2006. Yogic teachings are being implemented in public schools and even incorporated into Christian and Jewish worship services.</p>

			<p>“It’s just a very different approach to body, in my opinion, to soul, to mind,” says William Claassen, a student at alleyCat. “It’s all about connecting those things together, as opposed to isolating them.”</p>

			<p>Emilie Sabath, another of McRae’s students, uses yoga to enhance her filmmaking. Practicing yoga makes her more grounded and receptive to the world, and McRae, who provides a safe and inviting space for his students, is a key part of that, she says.</p>

			<p>Yoga appeals to McRae because it allows him to be himself without fear or restriction. “I would not want to be the person I was 20 years ago,” he says. “I’m much more peaceful, calm, centered, appreciating life just the way it is.”</p>

			<p>McRae shares his spiritual message with students but doesn’t go out of his way to invite new students to class. They come on their own, spurred by friends, family or even a Google search. His students follow their own path to yoga, just as he did.</p>
