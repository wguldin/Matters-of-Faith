		<article class="story_text">
			<p>Allie Gassmann arrives at the Unitarian Universalist Church promptly at 9 a.m. on a bright, warm Sunday. She’s nearly two hours early to the service.</p> 
			<p>She works swiftly but quietly as she sets up a small table for the monthly fair-trade coffee, tea and chocolate sale. The products are purchased directly from producers at a fair price. She unpacks box after box as her daughter, Leila, plays the church piano in the next room. For a while, they’re the only two there.</p>
			<p>This level of dedication and service is typical of Gassmann though she doesn’t like to boast. For her, spirituality is less about belief and more about taking action. </p>
			<p>One of her good friends, Kristine Smith, recognizes the rarity of knowing someone so dedicated yet humble about practicing her beliefs. “She’s the kind of person who does what she believes in,” Smith says. “It’s not just talk to her.”</p>
			<p>Gassmann strives to live sustainably. She rides her bike often and buys organic. She and her husband, Walter, even installed solar panels on their roof. “Without an environment that can sustain all of us, we will not be able to live the way we’re used to living,” Gassmann says.</p>
			<p>This awareness and activism has become important to Gassmann. It took her years, however, to find that this faith has had such a strong influence on her life.</p> 
			<p>Gassmann spent her childhood traveling. She was born in Germany and lived in Thailand, Korea and Greece before coming to the U.S. for college. While abroad, she was exposed to numerous faiths. She grew up going to Christian missionary schools and later went to a college founded by a Quaker though it is no longer affiliated with the religion.</p>
			<p>Over time, Gassmann began looking for something different. A Quaker friend suggested she attend a service at a Unitarian Universalist church nearby. She moved to Columbia in 2000 and has been a member ever since. She loves the opportunities the church provides for her to make a difference.</p>
			<p>“The UU churches have really offered me lots of ways to get involved and do something beyond my own selfish needs,” Gassmann says. “In that way, it has definitely changed my life.”</p>

		<div class="subhead">Her new home</div>

		<p>Despite being a small denomination with about 211,000 members nationwide, Unitarian Universalists, known as UUs, are proponents of progressive reform and social activism. Throughout its history, the church has championed causes such as freedom for slaves, civil rights and better working conditions for women.</p> 
		<p>The church doesn’t require its members to believe in a certain set of values or ideas. The <a href="http://www.uuchurch.net/minister.htm" target="_blank" class="body_link">Rev. Molly Housh Gordon,</a> the minister at the UU church in Columbia, says the denomination opted to create a covenant, or agreement. “Our lack of creed doesn’t mean we don’t believe things,” Gordon says. “It does mean there’s not a test of belief to be among us.”</p>
		<p>All UU churches share seven principles. Gordon calls the principles their “guiding statement.” Members aren’t required to subscribe to all the principles but are expected to commit to the spiritual journey. Gassmann identifies with the seventh principle that concerns the “respect for the interdependent web of all existence.” </p>

		<div class="subhead">Reaching out</div>

			<p>Gassmann participates in many church activities locally, but she is most engaged in a project far from Columbia. Gassmann and the <a href="http://www.uuchurch.net/honduras_news.htm" target="_blank" class="body_link">UU church</a> have gone on two trips to <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Las+Mangas,+Honduras&hl=en&ll=15.929638,-85.693359&spn=5.787056,9.876709&sll=15.199999,-86.241905&sspn=5.807602,9.876709&oq=las+mangas,+hon&t=h&hnear=Las+Mangas,+Colon,+Honduras&z=7&iwloc=A" target="_blank" class="body_link">Las Mangas,</a> a village in Honduras, to build latrines and volunteer. As Gassmann got to know these people, she discovered the village had another need.</p> 
			<p>The community is situated near a river. For three months every year, the river becomes too high to cross, which makes it impossible for kids to attend classes. To solve this problem, the people of Las Mangas want to install a canasta, a Spanish word meaning basket. A canasta is like a hand-powered zip-line that would allow four people to cross the river at a time.</p>
			<p>Gassmann knew she wanted to help. She got a committee together, and the church began raising funds. They have since reached the necessary $6,000 and sent it to Honduras, and the canasta was installed.</p>
			<p>“Doing something that can help those people who are less fortunate than we are is something that’s just very dear and close to my heart,” Gassmann says.</p>
