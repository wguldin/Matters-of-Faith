		<article class="story_text">
			<p>As she sits nestled against a suede green chair in her apartment on a late Saturday night, LySaundra Campbell imagines a conversation with her 12-year-old self. Her Bible, with verses highlighted in neon pink and blue, lies open on her lap as her hands rest on the worn pages.

			<p>“You are going to go through even more stuff in the next 10 years, but keep pushing through, and keep reading that scripture,” says LySaundra, whose index finger brushes the page.
			“And keep praying.”


			<div class="subhead">Understanding grace</div>

			<p>LySaundra remembers that shy, smart 12-year-old. She remembers how much she enjoyed playing the violin at her first orchestra concert. She remembers her daddy’s big smile after she skipped off the stage.</p>

			<p>Among all the happy memories, LySaundra also catches the sound of her mother’s sobs late at night. Somehow, she knew that her father was the cause.</p>

			<p>“In the morning (my brother and I) would go into my mom’s room and just give her a hug,” LySaundra says. “It’s all a little kid knows to do.”</p>

			<p>LySaundra, now a 22-year-old senior at MU, says she spent much of her adolescence building walls against the wounds that her father, Nathan Campbell, instilled when he abused LySaundra’s mother, Sandra Campbell.</p>

			<p>“There was a little bit of anger and a little bit of sadness and confusion,” LySaundra says. “I had temper tantrums in middle school because I didn’t know how to talk about it or who to talk to about it.”</p>

			<div class="subhead">The incident</div>

			<p>Sandra recounts what drove her daughter away from her father:</p>

			<p>In 1999, Sandra left Nathan and brought the kids to her hometown of Newport News, Va., because Nathan abused her. After a year, they moved back to Kansas City to be near Nathan, who had worked at the Kansas City Police Department. But Sandra says Nathan never stopped the physical and mental abuse.</p>

			<p>In April 2002, Sandra left again and took the children to her brother-in-law’s home in Kansas City. A few days later, Sandra was in the basement doing laundry when Nathan arrived and demanded that Sandra go home with him. She could tell from the tone of Nathan’s voice that something was not right.</p>

			<p>Then Sandra saw that he had a shotgun.</p>

			<p>“I came to the top of the stairs, and he said, ‘Bitch, you’re gonna die tonight.’”</p>

			<p>From a bedroom upstairs, LySaundra called the police. Today, she doesn’t regret it, but she used to find it ironic to call the police on her father who used to be a policeman.</p>

			<p>“He taught me as a little kid that if something goes wrong, you call the cops,” LySaundra says.
			Sandra says the 12 hours she spent being held hostage by her husband felt like days. “I had a feeling I was going to die, like he told me,” she says.</p>

			<p>At 3 the next morning, Nathan surrendered to police and was arrested.</p> 

			<div class="subhead">Moving on</div>

			<p>LySaundra remembers feeling scared at first, then angry.</p>

			<p>“Initially, I had the deepest hate for him you could have for somebody,” she says. “I didn’t want anything to do with him.”</p>

			<p>On her 12th birthday, in September 2002, LySaundra received a card from her father in jail. It read, “I love you no matter what you feel about me right now.”</p>

			<p>Three months later, LySaundra’s aunt picked her up after a sleepover and told her that her father had killed himself in jail the day before. During the following days, she got mixed messages from her relatives. “I didn’t feel guilt, but people kept saying, ‘This isn’t your fault.’ It made me think, ‘Wait, is it my fault?’”</p>

			<p>LySaundra says she put up barriers against her emotions during middle and high school. When she was a freshman at MU, LySaundra began to learn to forgive her father after getting involved with the Impact Movement, an international Christian ministry that has a chapter on campus.</p>

			<div class="pull_quote">
			<p>“I saw (God) as this big, majestic being that could strike you down at any moment ... I saw the domineering God and not the trusting God."</p>
			</div>

			<p>LySaundra says she began to understand that the anger for her father had kept her from exploring her relationship with God. “I couldn’t see God as a father figure because my relationship with my father was so strained,” she says. “Once I did start forgiving my father for everything, that intimacy with God got better.”</p>

			<p>Now, LySaundra works as a volunteer at True North, an organization that provides shelter and education for victims of domestic and sexual abuse, and is a peer educator at MU Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Center.</p>

			<p>Elyse Cagle, LySaundra’s mentor and friend from Impact, credits LySaundra’s growth to her work as an advocate for other victims of abuse. “I think she has grown into who she is,” Cagle says. “She now knows a little bit more of who she is as a daughter of God, as a child of God.”</p>

			<p>When people ask her what it means to work with victims of abuse, LySaundra often refers to a conversation with an 8-year-old girl at True North.</p>

			<div class="subhead">Growing stronger</div>

			<p>The girl told her she thought it was OK for boys to tease her because her daddy hurt her mommy. “I told her that if a guy is always being mean to you, then that’s not right,” LySaundra says. “‘He should be treating you like a queen.’ She got really excited and said, ‘Really? Like a queen?’”</p>

			<p>Sandra says her daughter proves it is possible to move on from the past.</p>

			<p>“It’s very good that she can reach out and talk to others,” Sandra says. “They can see that she’s been there before, and it’s going to be OK.”</p>

			<p>For LySaundra, her work as an advocate against abuse comes back to her Christian faith.</p>

			<p>Everything she has achieved since she was that timid 12-year-old can be attributed to her faith and one of her favorite pieces of scripture, James 1:2-3: “Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testament of your faith creates perseverance.”</p>

			<p>“God is using all of these situations to help my testimony and grow my faith in him,” she says. “He shows me that no matter what I go through, it’s going to make me stronger.”</p>
